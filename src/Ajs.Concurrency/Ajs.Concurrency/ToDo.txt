- SideJob & Poller:
	- Figure out how best to unit test
	- Cost vs Reward: Add CancellationTokenSource member variable to background actions to be able to expose .Cancel() property
		- Maybe this should be done through subclassing?

- New Classes:
	- LaneLocks
		- When locking can be based on a single value, can be useful instead of locking by dictionary
	- BackgroundTaskQueue
		- Add tasks to the queue for them to be processed on a background thread
		- Serves to reduce overhead from creating too many tasks, reduces pressure from the ThreadPool
		- Allows controlling of groups of tasks as a whole (IsBusy, IsCompleted)
